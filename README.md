# Social_Media_Survey_Form
This is a simple survey form for social media users. It is my first project for my [@freeCodeCamp.org](/www.github.com/freeCodeCamp.org) (New)Responsive Web Design Course.
The goal of this project is to use HTML & CSS to collect form data from users.

## ABOUT
The Social Media Survey Form collects data to understand how people(mostly youths) use social media platforms and the kind of improvements they would like to see on these platforms.
